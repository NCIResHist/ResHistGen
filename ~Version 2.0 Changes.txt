ResHistGen - Residential History Generation Programs
Version 2.0 - September, 2018

Summary of major changes:

* Expanded the array used for creating groups of commons addresses to 20 by 50 (was 20 by 10).

* Fixed a bug when adding new entries to the common address group array

* Added code to handle street numbers consisting of a number followed by single letter (e.g., 123B Main Street)

* New parameters:
	* MissingGeoLevel: geocoding level text string to be interpreted as missing
	* DistThresh: threshold in meters for matching addresses by distance
	* GeoLvlMax: maximum geocoding precision level for distance matching

* Modified the DurMin parameter used to specify a minimum duration for an address.  Now there are two parameters:
	* DurInMin: address minimum in days used for addresses coming in to the algorithm
	* DurOutMin: address minimum in days used for addresses coming out of the algorithm

* Added address information (street address, city, state, ZIP code) to final residential history dataset
